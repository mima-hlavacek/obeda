SettleUp can't sort members by total balance. This dashboard can!

Use `?group=<GROUP_ID>` to set which of your groups should be viewed. Find out
what your group ID is by going into the settle up webapp and opening your group.
The group ID will be a part of the URL, e.g.
`https://settleup.app/group/-LtdrPcCEM-OCaeboJod/transactions` has the group ID
`-LtdrPcCEM-OCaeboJod`, and
`https://mima-hlavacek.github.io/obeda?group=-LtdrPcCEM-OCaeboJod` views it.
